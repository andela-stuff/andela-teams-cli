# andela-teams-cli
This is the command line interface (CLI) for [Andela Teams](https://andela-teams.herokuapp.com). This consumes the andela-teams-core server (https://andela-teams-core.herokuapp.com) in carrying out its tasks.

Andela Teams seeks to automate some of the routine actions taken by __simulations learning facilitators__ at Andela.

Here is a useful scenario. When a new cohort (class) begins simulations (*sims*) at Andela, the cohort is broken into teams, and each team is assigned to a learning facilitator. The learning facilitator then creates a few Slack channels, a Github repo, and a Pivotal Tracker board. For each of these, the facilitator has to add every member of the team to the channel/repo/board. This is obviously a task that should be automated, especially considering that even the names of the channels/repo/board are always in a particular format. Andela Teams seeks to automate these and many more routine tasks performed by facilitators.

Andela Teams should be able to perform various actions like:
* view, create, edit, delete teams
* add members to teams, in various capacities (fellow, TTL, PO, ...)
* add events to the Google Calendar of team members
* generate various Google docs (like scorecards for fellows)
* send out email notifications to team members

The core server (backend) for this project is running [here](https://andela-teams-core.herokuapp.com), and has its codebase [here](https://github.com/andela-stuff/andela-teams-core).
